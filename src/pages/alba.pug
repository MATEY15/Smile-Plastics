                            p Alba is our best-selling material and you can see why#[br] – it’s sophisticated enough that it wouldn’t look out of place in Selfridges or #[br] Modern House, yet it’s also made from a humble kitchen cast-off: used yoghurt pots.
                            p With its white, marble-like surface and hints of gold and silver (from yoghurt pot foil), Alba isn’t just easy on the eye. It’s easy to use too.
                            p Available in 5mm, 12mm and 20mm thickness.

                            b Panel Information
                            p Every panel is unique, and colour and pattern may vary from sheet to sheet and from batch to batch. If you strictly need to minimise colour variation, discuss your needs with us prior to order to make sure all your material comes from the same batch.
                            p We try very hard to make our sheets as blemish-free as we can, but they are not perfect; for example, they may have dimples and minor marks which are outside our control. Please contact us to discuss this if it could be a problem.
                            p The listed board thicknesses are nominal: thermal expansion of some sheets can be 2mm per metre over a 10 degree (Celcius) range.
                            p High Impact Polystyrene is a flammable material and should be placed at a sufficient distance from any naked flame.

                            p 300cm×120cm, 200×100cm though often the panel will arrive slightly larger with unfinished edges (approx. 209×109cm).
                            b Thicknesses
                            p 5mm, 12mm, 20mm
                            b Prices and lead times
                            p Please email us at info@smile-plastics.com to enquire about prices and lead times, mentioning the quantity, and thickness of panels you require and any deadlines. Most of our panels are made to order and we hold very limited stock. Expect 2-8 week lead times for most orders. Smile Plastics’ terms and conditions apply to all sales.
                            b Shipping
                            p We are able to ship internationally within and outside of Europe as individual packages or on double pallets. Please email info@smile-plastics.com for a quote.

                            p We make up batches of Alba material in 5-10 tonne lots and batches will vary depending on the type of yoghurt pots we find. There will always be variations of a white/cream/off-white base with inclusions of silver, however there may also be colour inclusions which can vary in ratio and tone between batches. Here are some examples of current and previous batches of Alba.
